But they have different meanings, Looking at Guidance for one, This can be defined according to the American Personnel and Guidance Association (APGA, 1967) as an organized effort of a school to help individuals grow to their maximum potentials. While Rao (1981) Guidance is an assistance rendered to an individual to make intelligent choices and Adjustments. if you ask Athena(me) I’d say Guidance is the daily dose of life decisions your parents, pastors and elders give to us on how to go through life positively, They are guiding you and preparing you into the future.\n \n\tCounseling on the other hand is defined by Dustin and George (1983) as an assistance rendered to an individual to help increase adaptive behaviors and decrease maladaptive behaviors. This can easily be deduced as what comes after Parental or Elderly guidance has proven weak or had been gone against and then wrong choices have been made, Counseling looks out to correct these and decrease the ill mannered behaviors so it can help increase the good behaviors. This is essentially handled by a Professional who has undergone years of training with aims of understanding individuals and their ways of thoughts. \nFor more information on this topic, Please use this link below.
